# Christmas

Usual caveats apply - I'd much rather have fewer but better quality things. If you want to buy the expensive stuff but is too expensive (which some of it definitely is) please consider splitting with someone else!

## Expensive Stuff:

* Solovair boots (I leave style choice up to the fashionable) (size 9.5 but either 9/10 fit me) 
* Cast iron griddle / grill (prefer flat but reversible would also be good) (something like this https://www.amazon.co.uk/Lodge-Pre-Seasoned-Rectangular-Reversible-Griddle/dp/B093GR5SDX/) 


## Middle-ish Stuff:
* Thermapen One
* Steel cooking pan with lid 
* Quality Boxers (I like these: https://british-boxers.com/collections/stretch-trunks) 

## Books
* Mike Duncan - The Storm Before the Storm
* Coffeeland: A History 
* China's Gilded  Age 
* The Great Game - Peter Hopkirk
* Black Skin, White Masks
* influence the psychology of persuasion
* rich dad poor dad 
* The art of invisibility
* Notes from underground

# Clothes

I have no particular desire on clothes however most of my closet no longer fits me so would not say no. 

!! WARNING: I'm quite a bit differently shaped than before !!

!! My latest  measurements are: 
 Thighs: ~57cm,
 Hips: (measured via butt): ~98cm
 Waist: (belly button): ~85cm, 
 Chest: (pecs etc, no shoulders): ~100cm
 Biceps: ~36 cm
 
 Most M t-shirts are tight on my biceps / shoulders but loose on the waist 


## Plz no:
* Socks - I am inundated with socks. Please no more. 
* Anything 'Internet of Things'-y (e.g. alexa) - I dont trust that shi
